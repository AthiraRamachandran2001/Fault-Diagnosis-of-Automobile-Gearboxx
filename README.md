# Fault-Diagnosis-of-Automobile-Gearbox

Gears are very critical and a controlling component in power transmission systems, it is having wide area of application in the field of rotating machinery. In recent years the operational accuracy of gears are increasing as demand increases. Some of the minor errors like gear misalignment, backlash, and tooth cracks after running for some period of time this defect will create some form of vibration which will affect the supporting components like bearings, shafts to fail. So it is very important to monitor the condition of the gears to avoid run time breakdown of the machine. This system addresses the use of vibration signal for automated fault diagnosis of gearbox. In the experimental studies, good gears and face wear gears are used to collect vibration signals for good and faulty conditions of the gearbox. Each gear is tested with two different speeds and loading conditions. The statistical features are extracted from the acquired vibration signals. When user identifies an issue he registers a complaint. After registration the workshops can view the complaint and assign a mechanic for the job. Also send an email alert to the user from the mechanic. He reaches the location and identifies the fault using deep learning and rectify the fault and suggest remedies. He updates the status of the job.
